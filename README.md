##ASSETTS

Styles are written and compiled using vanilla Sass. Theme and assetts are from Twitter's Bootstrap. In praticular, they use the Bootswatch theme "Simplex".

The data used to populate the trails is pulled from trailapi.com

Databases are handled in MongoDB.

Sessions are handled using Express and Jade.
