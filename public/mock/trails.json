The singletrack trails (six of them I think) branch from a doubletrack dirt road.  There is another paved trail that is used a lot by hikers.  The Mt. Hood Trail is the best and the steepest.  Some rolling singletrack and roots to get the heart going.  The best thing to do here is explore.  I typically do 4-5 up-and-downs, trying to use different trails.  Go early to avoid crowds.
